				<h2>Welcome to Katie's Place.</h2>
				<p>Something exciting is happening in Shippensburg. A spirit of cooperation is blossoming among a broad network of people leading toward the development of a place where the community can come together to meet, build relationships and help each other reach our full potential together.</p>
				<p>Katie’s Place exists to serve as a gathering place for people of all ages and as a distribution site for charitable human services for the people of the Shippensburg community and the surrounding area. We are incorporated under the Pennsylvania Nonprofit Corporation Law and are organized exclusively for tax-exempt purposes as such purposes are defined by Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (or the corresponding section of any future Internal Revenue Law of the United States). Katie’s Place is registered with the Pennsylvania Department of State.</p>
				<p>In addition to the thriving and diverse Thrift Shop at Katie’s Place, the building houses a number of community organizations. Your support of both the organizations that are housed within the building, and Katie’s Place of  Shippensburg, Inc. is vital to the continued success of the Katie’s Place dream. Learn more about this by visiting the links at the bottom.</p>
